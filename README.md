# wdec v6

This is a Luau Bytecode Decompiler made by @luavm that decompiles luau bytecode to human-readable Source.

# Usage
```lua
game_httpget = function(s)
  return game:HttpGet(s)
end
local httpget = httpget or game_httpget or http_get -- add your httpget func here
loadstring(httpget("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arch-Foundation/wdec-v6/refs/heads/main/lua.luau"))()
decompile(script_path)
```
Replace script_path with whatever script you want to decompile.

You can pair it with writefile or setclipboard etc
e.x
```lua
setclipboard(decompile(game.ReplicatedStorage.ExampleScript))
```

# Flaws
There are multiple flaws with this decompiler:

~~1. The opcode list is not updated.~~

2. AST is partially broken: Reason: not all opcodes are supported and some have even changed behaviour, meaning they need a fix

~~3. Unhandled Opcodes: Due to the Opcode list not being complete, the deserializer can't pick out an invalid table index, so the decompiler (deserializer) errors.~~ Updated

3. Some opcodes not handled: TODO: Handle all opcodes.
 
4. Deprecated Opcodes: This list includes Deprecated opcodes.
 
~~5. BuiltIns are not complete, meaning not all functions can be retrieved.~~ Updated (maybe?)

5. Loops are also not present. (discovered: while .. do)

6. Instead of having else or elseif, the decompiler registers it as another statement so TODO: add reasonable else and elseif

7. The AST is somewhat broken due to not good handling (meaning the script won't be decompiled) (DISCORVERD: GETPUVAL, SETUPVAL, FORGPREP)

8. goto ops are invalid (operator is switched, causing it to displace an incorrect if statement)

9. someone can try to improve the way jumps are handled by adding while loops and making more use of them
